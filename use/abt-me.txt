SHORT
Shortly, I discovered coding by accident and I knew, it's love from the first sight! I found in programming a lot of joy by spending my time with nose into the code. My patience is helping me with solving code issues and hunger of knowledge is pushing me foward. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whather that be websites, applications or even games 2D. My goal is to become Fullstack Developer.

LONG
One day I was scribbling on paper my acctual status of raw materials in my carpentry workshop and then I had an idea - I need a program for that! And yeah... I wanted to do it on my own, so I tried... Code an ERP system isn't easy to do, even a tiny one, so I start with baby steps and I started to like it more and more. So I was keep reading, watching tutorials or listening podcasts and trying to code more challenging ideas. 

I've lost with my future live plan, my dream job wasn't so obvious on start. I was searching it for so long, but finally I found something I truly want to do and I'm getting satisfaction from it. I could be logistician, be an architect or even an artist, but as a programmer I can work and help in any categories! It's flexible enough to gain knowledge on any field. Now my dream is clear and someday I will be Fullstack Developer.
